#You can make comments in code! These comments are like sticky-notes. They don't execute.

# You can comment
# multiple lines
# in Sublime
# by selecting the area,
# then pressing Ctrl+/
#And do the same thing to unselect an area. try to uncomment the next line:
# x = 1
#Variable x is set to an int, 1.

#PROJECT 1: Set a variable for your birthday (int) and for your name (string).

#PROJECT 2: Print your name.

#PROJECT 3: Print "My name is [your name]. I am [age] years old."




#HINTS:
# Project 1) Google declaring ints and strings
# 2) Google printing strings
# 3) Google printing multiple items
